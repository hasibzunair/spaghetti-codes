# line-following-robots
Various line follower implementation with different kinds of IR sensors.

Contains programs used in competitions. It uses a 4 IR sensor array to detect black and white lines and Arduino as its main processing unit. Next phase is to improve the code for more complex tracks and also to add ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection.
