The objective of this project is to display a string of characters “ECE212 5” on a 7 segment display using a Combinational Logic Circuit.

Video Demo : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvexsQpNJ7A

This whole circuit uses two parts, a combinational logic and a sequential logic. It has one user input, when the switch is on the content is paused, when off it goes in a backwards loop. This also uses a two second delay between each character which is achieved by a 555 timer. This was my semeter project for Digital Electronics.Necessary resources are attached.
