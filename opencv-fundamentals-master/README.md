# opencv-tutorial-codes

Here I have listed the python scripts that were written during my time of the tutorial series on using opencv for image and video analysis by sendtex. Most of the images for applying those techniques are my own.

I have used the virtual environment in Pycharm. Change the directory in the python scripts when reading images, or simply keep the images in the same folder were the scripts are.

# Core libraries : 

1) cv2
2) numpy
3) matlplotlib.
