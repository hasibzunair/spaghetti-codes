# DC-Powered-Three-Wheeled-Electric-Scooter

Abstract : 

Battery powered electric scooters are of great convenience for use off roads. Generally they do not have engines and hence maintenance requires only cleaning and recharging for the most part. DC motors drive these scooters and one way to control the speed is through Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This paper describes the design and implementation of a three-wheeled scooter with a novel mechanical structure, which is powered by a rechargeable DC source and runs via logic provide by a micro controller. It is a low cost design that entirely uses parts available in Bangladesh local market. The simple and intuitive design can be easily disassembled and rebuilt. This design can be followed to build similar transport mechanism in other places or countries.
