# Control engineering project
Implementation of a PID controller.
# Abstract 
Servo motors are different kind of machines. It moves to a position that is specific with respect to the given signal with the help of error sensing feedback. It is used in industrial applications for robot arms, prosthetic limbs, automatic door opener, antenna positioning and many more. This report is based on the position control of the motor, its step response, mathematical model as well as its transfer function and its characteristics. The final goal of this project would be to stabilize the system with minimum oscillation and negligible steady state error.
