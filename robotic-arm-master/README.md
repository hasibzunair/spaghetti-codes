This is the first phase of my robotic arm. It consists on 5 servo motor for four independent movements. FOUR because two are used for the same movement. These are controlled using four potentiometers/ variable resistors. The basic idea is that when the potentiometer increases its value(turning) the angle of the servo motor changes accordingly. Components : Arduino Mega 10k Potentiometer 4x Servo Motors (13kg/cm) 5x 6V sunca battery (for powering those big bad motors)

This is the second phase of my robotic arm. This is completely autonomous. It picks up an object from a pre-defined location and drops it at a predefined location. This is repeated in every cycle. How boring!
